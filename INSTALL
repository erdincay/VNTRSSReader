First open VNTRSSReader and generate the library in release mode.

Afterwards open the Example.pro file and set up the library. The includepath is already given.
In main.cpp change the url to a valid RSS v2 service of your choice and build the project in release mode.

Now you can open your terminal and execute the Example console application. It should print you all entries of your RSS v2 service out.
